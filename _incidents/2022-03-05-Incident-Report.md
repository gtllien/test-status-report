We experienced an abnormal and heavy request load on our Accounts system which triggered intermittent resolution of Webengine pages and access to Manager UI from 4:22 PT to 5:26PT. Intermittent connections stopped at 5:26PT after engineers made a change in production to handle the abnormal requests.
