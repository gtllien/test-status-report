Accounts API had a deployment fail due to a silent deprecation of Google's hosted key management service. This deployment incident prevented Zesty.io Cloud users from logging into the platform from 12:05PM PT to 12:48PM PT. Websites hosted on Zesty.io Cloud WebEngine were not affected.

An update to the Accounts API codebase was made and deployed to accommodate for the deprecation.
