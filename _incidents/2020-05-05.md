[Instance API item creation](https://instances-api.zesty.org/?version=latest#887a7bc3-fc69-b22a-09d6-111635181c39) began returning 500 responses on May 5th 2020 at approximately 3am PT and was resolved by 8:15 PT. This was due to a bug exposed by a migration ran to support ongoing work towards WebEngine performance improvements. This affected all API consumers, such as the Zesty.io manager-ui.
